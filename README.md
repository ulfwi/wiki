# wiki

Finds shortest path between two wikipedia pages.

# TODO

* Check if wikipage actually exists
    * Add unit test for this
        * No path was found maybe?

* Add unit test for long paths

* Maybe create a Tree class that contains all nodes

* Add user input

* Download all of wikipedia
    * Maybe only swedish
