# TODO

* Check if wikipage actually exists
    * Add unit test for this
        * No path was found maybe?

* Add unit test for long paths

* Maybe create a Tree class that contains all nodes

* Write node module in C instead

* Save the title of the page in the node (e.g. "Adolf Hitler" instead of Adolf_Hitler)
    * Print this instead
        * Replace _ with space maybe

* File name searcher is not very sofisticated

* Add user input
